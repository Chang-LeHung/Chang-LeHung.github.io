Thread Basics:

* Thread operations include thread creation, termination, synchronization (joins,blocking), scheduling, data management and process interaction.
* A thread does not maintain a list of created threads, nor does it know the thread that created it.
* All threads within a process share the same address space.
* Threads in the same process share:
  * Process instructions
  * Most data
  * open files (descriptors)
  * signals and signal handlers
  * current working directory
  * User and group id
* Each thread has a unique:
  * Thread ID
  * set of registers, stack pointer
  * stack for local variables, return addresses
  * signal mask
  * priority
  * Return value: errno
* pthread functions return "0" if OK.

why not need to wake up a pthread_join thread ?
